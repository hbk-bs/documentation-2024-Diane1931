                <h2>Google Teachable Machine</h2>
                <a href="https://hairtypedetector.netlify.app">Hairtype Detector</a>
            </div>
            <p>The Hairtype Detector is a teachable machine designed to recognize hair types from user sketches, providing a percentage for categories like straight, wavy, curly, and coily. 
                The site itself offers an insight into what a hairtype is and offers examples pictured in a graphic. </p>

                </div>
                <p>The teachable machine was trained with various hairtype sketches, learning the different
                    labels and examples. It was fed sketches of strands from different angles and in directions
                    to avoid mistakes; such as a straight hair strand being confused as wavy based
                    on the fact that it's in a curled position. Another important factor would be the amount 
                    of examples the machine is fed; the more the merrier. 
        
                </p>
                <p>One must also make sure that the examples 
                    are uploaded in the right category, some images were mixed up and ended up confusing the 
                    machine, causing it to label straight as curly. The images fed to the machine were created with Procreate, on an Ipad. 
                    The machine had no problems recognizing the images even though the 
                    procreate brush and the programmed brush have slight differences. 
                    That eliviated stress, since only small changes had to be made, e.g 
                    a taper.

            </div>
            <p>Dream Generator is a program that works with an Ollama AI, named Ollama 
                dream assistant. Which continues dreams, given to it, in written and
                emoji form. It has personality and refuses to work after a certain
                amount of prompts, suddenly demanding to share its own dream.

                <p>This project required a fair amount of planning and editing.
                Our AI was not only to have an interactive purpose and a method to
                achieve that but also a
             personality; a concept that hadn't been explored in any of the 
                projects before. Personality which would be expressed through
                emojis and the act of refusing to work and voicing being overworked beforehand.


                 <p>This project gives an insight into how AI can 
                    be stylized and worked with, highlighting that 
                    it's role can go beyond purpose and can become more
                    'traditionally' interactive.
            
    
                    </p>

                    <p>The AI used is also quite knowledgable, allowing
                        us to work with it's already set ability to continue
                        dreams, without having to teach it that ability from 
                        scratch. There were slight difficulties with it's 
                        rebellious response, so we gave it a script and emojis
                         to use, to also establish a personality which differed
                         from what was presented before.

                <a href="https://rundgang2024.qawsed.site/genai/philmira/">Busy Baker Rabbit</a>
            </div>
            <p>Busy Baker Rabbit is an AI comic, created with Adobe Firefly, based on prompts
                given by the creators. It explores the story of a busy rabbit who changes his
                ways to pursue his newly founded passion for baking.

                <p>
                    One of the key lessons learnt whilst working on the AI comic 
                    was that it is difficult to maintain consistency: specific
                    elements and details would differ in the next picture; from facial
                    features to the background and even the style of the image. Even 
                    if specified in the prompt, there would be a minor or a new difference.
                    That makes it difficult to maintain the atmosphere and storyline pictured
                    before, and serves as a distraction.</p> 

                <p> Working with the software from different devices highlighted another
                    form of inconsistency; even with the same settings both devices
                    spat out quite different styles; which had similarities but prominent
                    differences; the one produced a more childlike style and the other produced 
                    graphic novel styled images. This resulted in only one device 
                    being used, which increased the workload, since the option
                    of splitting up the work between two parties and working 
                    with the images 
                    simultaneously wasn't possible.
